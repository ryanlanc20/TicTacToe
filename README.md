# TicTacToe
A TicTacToe terminal game implemented in C++.

## Running the game
If you use visual studio, you should be able to load this solution directly.
However, if you want to run the game outside of visual studio, you'll need to link the files at compile time.

Here is an example using g++.

```bash
    cd ./TicTacToe/TicTacToe
    g++ -o tictactoe TicTacToe.cpp Grid.cpp
```
